Given the tricycle mobile robot configuration The front wheel is used for both steering and traction. The unactuated rear wheels are for stabilization only. The steering angle is constrained between -45 and +45 degrees. The maximum linear and angular velocities should be bounded. and the initial posture of the robot Pi = (x, y, theta) and given the waypoints Wp = (x, y) the objective is;

  calculating global path which is passing through the way-points
  simulating path tracking of the robot and plot the linear and angular velocities (v, w) of the robot
